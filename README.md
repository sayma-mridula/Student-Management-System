        <li><strong>Search Student:</strong> Quickly find a specific student by their roll number.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Student:</strong> Seamlessly update the information of existing student records.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete Student:</strong> Remove a student record based on their roll number.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete All Students:</strong> Optionally delete all student records from the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Compile:</strong> Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>Run:</strong> Execute the compiled binary to launch the program.</li>
        <li><strong>Main Menu:</strong> Follow the on-screen instructions presented in the main menu to perform desired operations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>File Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>main.cpp:</strong> Contains the main program code, including the implementation of the Student Management System functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>student.txt:</strong> Binary file storing student records.</li>
        <li><strong>temp.txt:</strong> Temporary file used for certain operations, such as deleting student records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the student.txt file resides in the same directory as the executable for proper data storage and retrieval.</li>
        <li>Always input valid data to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.</li>
        <li>Exercise caution when performing operations like deleting all student records, as it is irreversible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance file handling by implementing database technologies for improved data management.</li>
        <li>Expand functionality to include additional student details or features, such as grades, courses, or attendance tracking.</li>
        <li>Improve user interface and input validation for enhanced user experience.</li>
    </ul>
